### Inviting

Upgrade numbers (check their history to judge!)

:arrowred: Pilots flying a megathron must be in another ship by 40 hours in fleet. This can be another starter ship.
:arrowyellow: By 60 hours, some improvement should be shown. Upgrade your ship to a standard fit or train basic skills. 
:arrowgreen: All pilots are expected to have at least one standard fit ship, with basic skills for that ship, by the time they have flown with us for 120 hours. 


### Multiboxing

1. Alts should be dropped in favor of a real players, even starter.
2. Multiboxing is a privilege, not a right. If someone can't handle the amount of toons they are trying to bring, limit them.

### Logi requirements
1. People may only bring 1 Logi to fleets. **People cannot multibox logi pilots**. They can run multiple other ships with 1 logi pilot being their main focus for repping reasons.
2. Guardian and Oneiros pilots with Logi Cruiser 4 require the mindflood drug while running.

### Misc

1. FC Trainees require an FC to backseat to have SRP available.
2. FC Advanced Trainee can run HQs (except TCRC) on their own with SRP available.

## SRP

Use the discord [srp channel](https://discord.com/channels/1028666338383777873/1035282315951218689) and look at pinned messages.
