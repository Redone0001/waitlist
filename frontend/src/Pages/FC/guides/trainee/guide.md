## Fleet Start Safety Speech

LOGIs build your watch lists:
- FC
- armor/skirm boosters
- other logis
- bastion

Make sure arrows at the bottom of the fleet window are pointing in all four directions.
During fleet. When you become yellow boxed by NPCs, Broadcast for armor.

All Drones must be set to passive and focus fire and assigned to appropriate drone bunnies unless specified otherwise.
Emergency warp should be left unchecked, please confirm yours is set correctly.
X-tag is a fleet safety tag, please never shoot X tags.
However FC voice has higher priority than tags, you must listen to and follow FC commands at all times.

To join fleet, Warp to FC twice, if you get the error message natural phenomena, ask for gate status.

Last but not least, we strongly recommend that you pay [*SRP amount*](/guide/xup#ship-replacement-program-4) for full focus to the ship replacement program AKA SRP (details in fleet MOTD). It covers your ship for FC and LOGI errors only.

Any questions?

## Site Run Method

Please note this is the everything going well playbook. Every FC is responsible for fleet safety.
Adjust the behavior and your command when needed.

### NRF - lazy way (best for multibox fleet)

- Do the following steps before initial wave is dead. Use a Tag X if needed:
     1. Anchor the full fleet on the Logi spot, drone boat anchor sit 10km above you.
     1. Make sure the meatshield is in position.
- Clear all waves
- For last wave use all power to clear Intaki, Deltole and Outini then normal order.

### NRF - normal way

Pre setup:
- 6-8 paladin in a "group" will be called "group 1"
- all other paladin in "group 2"

#### Intial Wave:

1. Get battleship/battle cruiser in. 5-8s later everyone in.
1. *Group 1* bastion and clear mara > Deltole.
1. Rest of the fleet get into position quickly while killing the initial wave.

### When meatshield is in position

1. Group 2 paladin bastion until end of site.

#### First Wave:

1. *Group 1* & kronos bastion
1. Clear the wave.

#### Second Wave (Mara wave):

1. Depending on your fleet size, rebastion *group 1*.
1. Clear the wave.

#### Last Wave (Outini wave):

1. *Group 1* of paladin jump and clear the far spawn.
1. Rest of the fleet bastion.
1. Clear the wave.


### TPPH

#### room 1 & 2:

1. Bastion paladin on beacon.
1. Burn jump the rest of the fleet.

#### room 3:

1. Bastion few paladins (*group 1*) on beacon.
1. Burn jump the rest of the fleet.
1. Keep an Osti tag X until everyone is in position.
1. Bastion on every wave spawn for 1 cycle and clear the waves.
1. Kill the tower.


### TCRC

- Entry:
     1. Meatshield get in.
     1. Meatshield confirm full spawn.
     1. Full fleet in.
     1. Tag while landing.
     1. All paladin bastion to clear the Deltole & Outini.
     1. Kronos (at least 2-3) jump to the tower and apply damage.
     1. Rest of the fleet burn. Drop drone on the tower only.
     1. On aggro swap, bastion the kronos on tower.

- Main:
     1. Bastion after a full swap (all Osti + all Yulai).
     1. Spot a good extraction align.

- Exit:
     1. Align when tower is low.
	 1. MTAC warp out.
     1. Clear any tackle (tag X).
     1. Warp the DPS/Sniper off grid. Only logi, your booster (armor) and the primary stays.
     1. Check that nobody is bumpuing on bubble / battery.
     1. Fleet warp everyone off.
	 
## Thing to do and not do

### DO

1. Watch laser and see if the agro goes to someone. Don't rely on people to call agro.
1. Keep comms disciple. Some people are here to have a social time other are here to make money. Shout should be use wisely and entry/exit should be quiet.
1. Be clear on comms.
1. Lock tag X and make sure it stays alive.
1. During unplanned event, talk to the fleet and/or the people involve.
1. Be aware of your grid. Position of everyone is important.


### DON'T

1. Stay on beacon for long period of time. It's ok to slide TPPH/NRF entry with low links and pulse inside.
1. Bypass rules. Thoses are meant to keep everyone safe. If you are not sure, ask someone knowledgeable.
1. Run site in another way than mention above. (Normal TCRC should never be done)
1. Run whithout your own links.
1. Invite people with bad drones.

### Isk improvement Method

1. All paper work can be done during the site.
1. TPPH/NRF gate green before fleet lands.
1. Get rid of tag X faster
1. Align out before end of site. TPPH/NRF let people warp out themself when they have drones/payout.
1. More marauders
1. Even more marauders
1. In NRF, paladin of group 2 can bastion all the time, even between waves. They only need to be in correct position and meatshield as well.
