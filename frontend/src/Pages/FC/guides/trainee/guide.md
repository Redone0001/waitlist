## Fleet Start Safety Speech

LOGIs build your watch lists:
- FC
- armor/skirm boosters
- other logis
- bastion

Make sure arrows at the bottom of the fleet window are pointing in all four directions.
During fleet. When you become yellow boxed by NPCs, Broadcast for armor.

All Drones must be set to passive and focus fire and assigned to appropriate drone bunnies unless specified otherwise.
Emergency warp should be left unchecked, please confirm yours is set correctly.
X-tag is a fleet safety tag, please never shoot X tags.
However FC voice has higher priority than tags, you must listen to and follow FC commands at all times.

To join fleet, Warp to FC twice, if you get the error message natural phenomena, ask for gate status.

Last but not least, we strongly recommend that you pay 30 mil for the day or 100m for full focus to the ship replacement program AKA SRP (details in fleet MOTD). It covers your ship for FC and LOGI errors only.
