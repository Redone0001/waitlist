## Voicing fleets: 
- Can be done prior to getting a trainee badge 
- Requires a working knowledge of tags, sites and some brain cells.



## Trainee FC
- Cannot take HQ fleets without a qualified, tagged, backseat. 
- Backseat or another fc in fleet must bring backup primary booster and it is highly recommended that they be in a nestor 
- Trainees do have access to fits on the waitlist, but the backseat is responsible for double checking fits, inviting and the motd. (backseat should have the star)
- Trainee must do the safety speech at the start of every fleet. Backseat should prompt them to do so if they try to take a gate without it. 
- Trainees cannot take training nestors and should be encouraged to do their own tags where able (unless they are oversaturated in which case feel free to help out)
- Trainees can only take pilots who meet SRP standards NO EXCEPTIONS. This means ensuring that pilots have the correct fits and skills. 
- Trainees should be encouraged to get backseats from multiple FC’s (timezone permitting). 
- HQ Trainees cannot FC if redbar is above 75%. 


Things to check in initial training period: 
1. Are they keeping the fleet safe? 
This includes but is not limited to; Repping (if they are in a nestor), checking the other logi are repping, calling for heat when needed, calling switches, calling bastion/ no bastion, checking boosts are running/ keeping boosts cycling and checking for anyone who is out of position / may take aggro. 
2. Are they keeping control of the fleet? 
This includes but is not limited to; keeping comms clear when needed (such as TCRC exits), calling gates, making sure no one is shooting the x tags, calling for drones to be dropped, tagging, dealing with leeroys, keeping track of roles and newbro speeches (this can be asking another fc to take care of the speech, and the trainee resolving issues as they crop up).
3. Tagging
Tagging should be fast, consistent and in an order that makes sense.
Try and gauge whether the trainee memorised the tagging guide, or if they understand why we tag things in the way that we do.
Remembering to put up x tags and tag all scrams (TOADS)  when bouncing, or needing to get off grid asap, is very important and should be stressed. 
4. Basic Knowledge
Does the fc know/ understand things such as logi rep ranges, boost distances and % and what each role does in enough detail that they could explain it to a newbro.
Are they aware of which rats are scrams and do they have a basic idea of what to do in a potential PVP situation. More advanced knowledge should be tested in advanced training. 

If the backseat thinks that the trainee checks most of these boxes, they can recommend the trainee for advanced trainee using the backseat report.
Two or more more fc trainers must agree that the trainee is ready in order for them to advance. 


## Advanced trainee FC
- Have access to the fits on the waitlist. 
- Should be checking fits, invites and updating the MOTD (can have the star).
- Must have a fully trained, mindlinked primary booster.
- Can Run TPPH and NRF with SRP and no backseat.
- Must still have a backseat for TCRC

The backseat should reinforce the concepts introduced in the initial training period as well as introducing more detailed knowledge, and safe stress tests. 

### Knowledge to be tested: 
1. Detailed information about NPC mechanics. This could be a variety of things, but should ensure that the trainee knows enough to keep the fleet safe alone. As a basic guideline, check for knowledge on scram/ neut ranges, which rats have highest EHP, lowest resists, which rats to kill first and why etc. 
1. Site knowledge: This is including but not limited to; wave triggers for TPPH’s/ TCRC’s, min and max wave sizes for NRF’s, respawn timers for TCRC rats, which spots are likely to take aggro i.e booster spots and why they work, mtac timers, and why the logi are anchored where they are. 
1. Logistics knowledge: This is including but not limited to; when to battle rep vs when not to battle rep,  nestor and cruiser rep ranges, when to call for heat/ stop calling for heat, when to have logi burn towards an aggro target, what oni links do etc. 
1. PVP knowledge: Test if the trainee knows what to do in a PVP situation. 
1. Does the trainee know how to safely get new fleet members to the main fleet? Can the trainee adopt the correct techniques when hostiles enter system and still run the fleet safely?Does the trainee understand why changes are made to how we run fleets when there are hostiles in system? Does the trainee know when to stand the fleet down? 

### Safe stress tests (for FC Trainer + ONLY): 
If the backseat believes that the trainee has good control of the fleet under normal circumstances they are allowed to create safe theoretical training scenarios.
Examples of this could be:
1. Sperging to test ability to control comms in hectic situations
1. Intentionally being out of position to check grid awareness
1. Not broadcasting when you (the backseat) get aggro/ asking trusted pilots/ FC’s to not broadcast
1. Causing split aggro (preferably not in a TCRC), by warping scouts into sites and warping them off.
1. Running normal TCRC’s 
1. Killing X tags
More Dangerous Stress tests: 
1. Intentionally sitting on the beacon with aggro 
1. Intentionally leeroying TCRC’s 
1. Pulling the spawn in TCRC’s 
1. Warping the meatshield out (in any sites but mainly TCRC’s)
1. MJDing with aggro
1. Simulating loss of logi 
1. Simulating loss of comms 

This is not an exhaustive list.
As the backseat you may test your trainee as you see fit but use some **common sense**.
Try not to put anyone in danger that isn’t prepared to replace their ship or deal with the consequences.
As the backseat it is your job to know how far to push the trainee, if they are struggling to maintain fleet safety then continuing to stress test may cause unnecessary dangerous situations. 

Unless you are intentionally trying to be kicked from the fleet, respect the trainee.
If they tell you to do/ not do something, follow their direction.
If they passed whatever you were trying to test there is no need to continue. 

If the trainee is displaying that they can run a fleet safely after this then it may be time to bus them. 

## Bus fleet

The bus fleet is designed to reinforce all of the above points whilst still making sure the trainee can run a safe and  (at least semi) efficient fleet. 

Bus fleets can **only** be ran by FC Trainers and above.
Trainees will be tested on dangerous situations that could happen in the fleet.
Make the scenarios realistic, there’s no need to troll for the sake of trolling. 
To pass a bus fleet, a trainee needs two +1s from Two FC Trainers or above.
One +1 is not enough. 

**If you are not the active backseat ensure you get the backseats permission for anything that you want to do that could be dangerous.**
**Do not try and backseat the backseat, it gets confusing for everyone.**

**DISCLAIMER: FLEET SAFETY IS PARAMOUNT AND AS THE BACKSEAT YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSSES THAT HAPPEN.**
