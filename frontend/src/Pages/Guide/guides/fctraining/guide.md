# Becoming an FC

---

## Tryouts

Beancursion is always looking for new FC's.
Is fleet down during your prime time? Want to fix that?

There is no pressure to accept a T badge straight away.
You can ask to voice and/or tag a few fleets, see if it's for you.
All thats required is an L badge! You can ask any full FC to do a tryout, you can do up to five tryouts.
All you need to know before starting a tryout is on this page, tagging order and shortcuts.
You don't need to have tags completely memorized for the first fleet.

If you have any doubts or questions, ask any FC.

## Joining the training program

## Training Program Stages

### Trainee

In this first stage you will learn how to voice fleet, tag and do waitlist invites/motd updates. You will be expected to learn and know every role and anchor position.

### Advanced Trainee

In this stage, efficiency, safety and in depth knowledge will be taught and expected.
You will need to master fleet control and knowing how the agro mechanics work.
PvP situation should not scare you.
Knowing NPC's and why we tag them the way we do. 
Fleet control will also need to be mastered.


Progressing to the next stage requires passing **BUS FLEET** along with getting at least one other +1 from any FC Trainerthat was not the active backseat.

## Fleet requirement

- Logi: 4 nestor (5 guard = 2 nestor), min 2 nestor for TCRC (no guard only)
- Links: Armor links ML with cmd ship 5
- DPS: 2 kronos + 5 paladins

## Tagging

You can have this open on your phone in your tryouts and/or first trainee fleets. Make sure to set shortcuts for tagging, you need the sequencers 1 - 9 and A - I, a seperate shortcut for X tag and a shortcut for broadcast align. **Some of these tags can be done differently, you will learn what you prefer while FCing.**

# VG sites, tips & tricks

## Preload Override Transfer Arrays
Warp in a scout, immediately warp it out. 20 minutes later the (respawning) Eysturs (that eat drones) will have despawned.
Have the scout tag the site beacon with *letter* tags (in order) so the FC knows which site is which.

## Tag priorities

__Nation Mining Colony__
Wave 1: Mara - Romi, have DDD go through frigs, secondary webs spread on primary, then secondary targets.
Wave 2&3: Niarjas, try to blap Tamas with Pallies until they're closer than 40km, then cruisers, finally kill all frigs.

__Nation Commander Outpost__
Wave 1: Paladins go Niarja, Romis, then webbed frigs. DPS goes Niarja, then frigs (Tama, Schmaeel, Renyn, Eystur)
Wave 2: Niarja, Auga, Tamas, Schmaeels, Renyns, Eysturs
Wave 3: Sanshas Nation Commander, Augas, Tamas, rest of the frigs
Wave 4: Freefire Niarja & Tamas, then blap Schmaeels & Renyns, finally kill Eysturs

__Override Transfer Array__
All waves: Ignore Eysturs if they're there. Don't launch small drones if there's Eysturs in the site.
Wave 1&2: Blap Niarjas & Tamas with Pallies (swap off Tamas once they're <40 km off and have DPS take over there), then Augas, then Deltole
Wave 3: Niarja, Auga, Deltole, finally Tamas. (Some Tamas are not essential to finishing the site.)
