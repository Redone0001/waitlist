# Leshak guide

---

The leshak is a triglavian ship using their special gun mechanic to deal DPS.
This guide will provide explanation on the ship and how to fly it.

## What's special about the precursor weapon system ?

- Has a spool/ramp-up dps, the longer you shoot at a target the more DPS you make.
- Stop firing (to reload, because you got ecm or changing amo) reset your spooling.
- Doesn't have a falloff, it's eaither you do shoot or not. You can't start spooling and get closer to actually do damage.
- As laser amo change is instant.
- Low amo consumption.

## How to fly the leshak:

### General consideration
- Don't change amo while shooting only change between target.
- Shoot the last battleship to die => usually Osti.
- You can heat your gun for very long time and nanite repair are cheaper.
- Heat at the start of spool to get higher DPS faster.
- You can use your 4 rep all the time if a guardian provide 1 cap transfert to you. You would rep as much as haf a nestor (and this will count in your participation for agro mechanics)


### TPPH
- first 2 room simply burn to out gate (don't jump you don't have the mjd cooldown bonus).
- last room burn to logi anchor position.
- shoot last or second to last Osti with mystic while burning and swap to ocult for last 2 waves in 3rd room.

### NRF
- Brun to logi position
- Use mystic on initial wave and shoot last or second to last Osti in the rest of the wave. 
- Depending on fleet size shoot last outini in last wave.

### TCRC
- Jump to the tower
- Shoot tower with ocult and drop ogre


## Upgrades and skills
- Don't train gun specialisation, all you need is level 1 to use the T2 amo, more is wasted
- Train Precursor Battleship lvl 5 ASAP
- Implants wize get them in this order: **RF-906** > HG-1006 > EM-806 > High-grade Mimesis Set
- Modules wize upgrade in the following order: Abyssal Steel Plates > Abyssal Radiation Sink II > B-type Energized Membrane
