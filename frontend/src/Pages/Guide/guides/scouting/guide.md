## Preloading TCRCs

The TCRC site is special in that it takes about half a minute for all Sansha rats to spawn. If a fleet goes in before everything has spawned then the aggression will be split, making the site less safe and creating more work for the logi.

Loading a TCRC starts the moment a player shows up on the _grid_, which you can do by taking the gate. Once you land in the site, you can choose to either cloak up (if you land within 2000m of the beacon you may need to use the Q align function to move away from the beacon, do not ever use your MWD as it will blow your sig and the frigates will lock you much faster preventing you from cloaking.), or warp away.

If you do cloak, make sure to either warp off before the _meatshield_ goes in, or after the entire fleet has landed and aggro is established on the meatshield. If your timing is wrong, the aggro can go to the scout instead of the meatshield, with potentially deadly results for both your scout and members of the fleet.

The FC will appreciate it if you tag the two _Schmaeels_ close to the MTAC factory (or Romi), and the only _Auga_ that spawns. Those two _Schmaeels_ in particular will respawn, so we do not want to shoot them until the site is done.

Preloading a TCRC is somewhat risky and you may lose your ship if you're not paying attention!

## Timers

When a site ends, a new one will spawn in roughly 7 minutes and 10 seconds. By setting a timer every time a site goes down you can accurately predict when new sites spawn, and this can help the FC decide whether to wait a few more seconds before starting a site we don't like. A useful website for this is [online-timers.com](https://www.online-timers.com/multiple-timers).

## Thank you

Scouting is a very important fleet role, and you really help the FC a lot by doing it. Site times go down a lot with a good scout. Thank you for being awesome!
