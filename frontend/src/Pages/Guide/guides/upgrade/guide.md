# Upgrading

---

## Policy

Beancursion has great affordable starter fits. We will help you get spacerich & we have a SRP to make sure you keep that ship. After you have fully upgraded to optimal, spend the isk any way you want.

**We expect all pilots to upgrade to standard in a reasonable amount of time, which will involve upgrading the ship itself, but also your skills and implants. Until you are standard, you should expect to spend most of your earned money buying modules and skill injectors.**

We have limits for the time you can spend in fleet while upgrading, but donâ€™t treat these as targets. Upgrade as soon as you reasonably can, and you will stay well within the limits. Please also be aware, getting your optimal badge on one ship should be your first priority, if your a new character we do not recommend trying lots of different ships as the upgrade limit is very streamlined. So consider carefully which ship you wish to fly.

Beancursion works with a tier system. Pilots can be categorized as starter, standard, optimal and optimal gold. Your current status is determined by fit and lowest skill tier.

**You must reach the tier by the time limit set out in the table below:**

|        Tier        | Time Limit |
| :----------------: | :--------: |
|    Megathron\*     |    40h     |
|      Starter      |    60h     |
|      Standard      |    120h    |
|      Optimal      |    \*\*    |

\* We have the megatron as a very esay to get into ship, we ask you to upgrade this sonner than the other BS.

\*\* Optimal is for beans that want to spent more money, it's not asked to upgrade to it but very much appreciated.

## Upgrade guidance for DPS

### Starter

1. **Get a [starter fit](/fits?Tier=Starter)**, you will need level 2 armor compensation skills to be able to x-up, and you need to be able to online all the modules from the fit. We recommend the Vindi or Nightmare starters.

(If you are Alpha status and cannot use the MJD in the cargo this is fine, we understand pilots will need time to Omega their accounts) If you're low on ISK, you can start by getting the **Megathron**. If you do, it's important that you focus on upgrading to another ship as soon as possible.

2. Omega your account **ASAP**. Start with one month, its plenty!
3. If you are still in a Megathron get yourself a Vindi or Nightmare starter fit. **\*(You must be out of a megathron by 40 hours of fleet time)**.
4. Past 60 hours in fleet its important to show progression in your upgrading, either via ship, skills, or fit.

### Standard

1. **Upgrade to a [standard fit](/fits?Tier=standard)** as soon as you can, to do this train/inject armor compensation skills to level 4 first.
2. **Tank and rig change to standard fit or better** (do this upgrade all at once!) All rigs and tank modules must be changed to match the standard fit or you will not be allowed to join fleet, **DO NOT TRY TO MIX AND MATCH**. These modules include:

- Damage Control Units
- Multispectrum Coatings
- Multispectrum Energized Membranes
- Burst Aerator Rigs
- Rigs (Thermal, EM, Kinetic, Explosive, Trimark, etc.)

3. **Train the red Starter coloured skills**, these skills are keeping you in starter queue so prioritise them over everything else!
4. **Train and get T2 guns** and the remainder of the standard fit modules starting with the Core X-Type MWD (this will help greatly with your cap stability) then Magnetic Field Stabilizers & Heat Sinks etc.

Once you have the standard fit ready to go, continue **training and injecting standard skills** which will help your capacitor stability and the ability to keep up with the fleet. At this point you are no longer starter and will be placed in a normal squad, congratulations!

**At this point we would like to thank you for upgrading, you can spend your isk as you see fit from this point on.**
_Dont forget to ask an FC to scan you for your optimal badge so that you are eligible to join optimal fleets and reap the rewards of your hard work!_

### Optimal

1. **Upgrade to [optimal fits](/fits?Tier=optimal)**. You do not need to have every skill at optimal level to fly the fit. You will need the mid-grade set to fly hybrid fit. Go buy those upgrades while still training/injecting the skills.

2. Finish by getting all the **elite skills**. The order is up to you, but we recommend getting the skills that give the biggest damage increase first, and of course maximize your survivability by upgrading the tank skills.

3. This is a good time to get **abyssal modules**. [Mutaplasmid.space](https://mutaplasmid.space/) is a good website for finding contracts, but remember abyssals must be "better than faction". The [General tips](/guide/tips) guide gives advice on what to look for when purchasing abyssals.

### Optimal gold

1. Finally, once you have all skills to optimal gold for your ship get your **optimal gold** badge to show off your awesomeness. Just ask any FC who is not running the current fleet to check you meet the requirements. This is just a skill check on the site.

### Branch out

Once you're done upgrading, consider branching out to another ship. Maybe try logistics and work toward the Logistics specialist badge. If you are in a timezone with low pilot numbers consider training up another DPS alt and earn twice the payouts! Once you have your optimal badge pilots are allowed to bring a doctrine fitted alt to fleet with an Advanced fit or better. **Alts are also expected to be upgraded and are held to the same standards as your main.**
