# Wormholes

## General knowledge

Wormholes actually refers to 2 different but related concept.
1. The wormhole space as the system with a star and everything like any other system.
1. The "gate" wormhole. It's a temporary gate with some limitation on what ship can use it. WH connect 2 system (HS / LS / NS / WH) as long as they are there.

These need to be scanned to be able to warp to and they have 2 important atribute:
1. Mass
1. Max ship size 

Those 2 are related all details can be found here: [eve wiki WH attributes](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Wormhole_attributes)

## Terminology

- *J-space*: wormhole system name are like: Jxxxxx
- *Going in*: means you are going in to the WH from known space (usually said with hot or cold)
- *Coming out*: means you are coming out of the WH from J-space (usually said with hot or cold)
- *Hot*: Going or coming hot means your Afterburner or MWD is on when you jump through the WH. This is important when doing math later.
- *Cold*: Going or coming cold means your Afterburner or MWD is off when you jump through the WH. This is important when doing math later.
- *Rolling*: the WH - to close the WH completely, killing it.
- *Critting*: the WH - to bring the WH close to but not killing it  (less than 10%, when the information on the said WH shows that the stability is disrupted to a critical degree, again read the links).
- *Fresh*: Wh is still over 50% mass on the show info you will read: *This wormhole has not yet had its stability significantly disrupted by ships passing through it*
- *Shrink*: WH less than 50% mass on the show info you will read: *This wormhole has had its stability reduced by ships passing through it, but* ***not to a critical*** *degree yet*
- *Crit*: WH less than 10% mass on the show info you will read: *This wormhole has had its stability critically disrupted by the mass of numerous ships passing through and is on the* ***verge of collapse***

## The math

In incursion we have 3 type of roller, they all are handout and you don't need to buy them yourself.

| Ship      | Cold | Hot |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Megatron    | 196  | 296  |
| Sigil       | 22   | 122  |
| Carrier     | 1400 | 1912 |

With this information you can calculate how many passage you need to crit or roll a hole.
During the roll keep an eye on the show info to make sure the shrink is at the right moment. 
Some variation in wh mass can lead to getting stuck.
Rolling ship are designed to be cheap and easy to replace don't worry too much about lossing them.

| WH type | T. Mass | Mega | Sigil | Carrier |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| K329 | 5000 | 17H + 1C | 41H + 1C | 2H + o |
| XL | 3300 | 11H + 1C | 27H + 1C | 2H |
| Thera | 3000 | 10H + 1C | 24H + 1C | N/A |
| XL | 3000 | 11H + 1C | 27H + 1C | 2H |
| L | 2000 | 5-6H + 2C | 16H + 1C | N/A |
| Poch | 1000 |4H | 8H + 2C | N/A |
| S | 1000 | N/A | N/A | N/A |
